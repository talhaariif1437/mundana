			<p>
			Sami people (also known as Saami or Lapps) are an indigenous ethnic group native to the northern parts of Europe, specifically the S√°pmi region, which stretches across parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Kola Peninsula in Russia. The Sami are one of the few indigenous groups in Europe and have a distinct culture, language, and history that set them apart from the majority populations of the countries they inhabit.


			</p>
			<h3><b>1. Language
			</b></h3><br>
			
			<p>
				The Sami speak Sami languages, which belong to the Uralic language family, related to Finnish and Estonian. These languages are divided into several dialects, with the most widely spoken being Northern Sami, used by many Sami in Norway, Sweden, and Finland.
                            <br><br>
				Due to historical pressures and assimilation policies, the Sami languages have faced decline, and many Sami people now also speak the dominant languages of the countries they live in (Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, and Russian). However, efforts are underway to revitalize Sami languages, including language schools and media in Sami languages.			
			</p>
			<h3><b>2. Traditional Clothing
			</b></h3><br>
			<p>
				Traditional Sami clothing is known as the "g√°kti", which varies in style, color, and design depending on the region and specific Sami group. The g√°kti is typically made from wool or reindeer skin, with vibrant colors like red, blue, and green, and adorned with embroidery, silver jewelry, and decorative bands.

                        <br><br>
				For men, the g√°kti is a tunic with a belt, while women wear a long skirt or dress, often with a headdress.
						<br><br>
				Silver jewelry, particularly large brooches (known as "duodji"), is a significant part of the traditional outfit, often passed down through generations. The jewelry designs are symbolic and reflect Sami craftsmanship and history.
					</p>


			<h3><b>3. Lifestyle and Livelihood</b></h3><br>
			<p>
				Traditionally, the Sami were reindeer herders, and reindeer herding remains central to Sami culture, especially for those living in the northernmost areas of S√°pmi. Reindeer provide food, clothing, and transportation, and the practice is deeply integrated into the Sami way of life.
                          <br><br>
				Fishing and hunting have also been important aspects of Sami subsistence, particularly in coastal and inland areas. Sami communities living in Norway and Sweden often engage in these activities for sustenance.
				<br><br>
				In addition to reindeer herding, some Sami have been involved in farming, crafts, and trading, and today many Sami work in various professions, including in the arts, education, and tourism.
			
			</p>
			<h3><b>4. Religion and Spirituality</b></h3><br>
			<p>
				The Sami traditionally practiced animism and believed in spirits that inhabited nature, such as animals, trees, and stones. Shamanism was an important part of their belief system, with spiritual leaders known as noaidi (shamans) performing rituals to communicate with the spiritual world and to guide their people.
                 <br><br>
				 The arrival of Christianity in the region, particularly through the influence of missionaries from Sweden, Norway, and Russia, led to a significant transformation in Sami religious practices. Today, most Sami are Christians, particularly in the Lutheran faith, though some retain elements of their indigenous spiritual practices.
			   <br><br>
			   √Årran, or sacred places, such as mountains or specific trees, are still revered in Sami tradition, and some Sami continue to celebrate spiritual events linked to the natural world.	
			</p>
			<h3><b>5. Art and Crafts</b></h3><br>
			<p>
				The Sami are known for their craftsmanship (referred to as duodji), which includes making tools, clothing, and decorative items. Traditional crafts include wood carving, textiles, silverwork, and leatherwork. These crafts are not only functional but also have cultural and spiritual significance.
                         <br><br>
				Joik, a traditional form of song or chanting, is an important aspect of Sami culture. It is often used to convey stories, emotions, or events, and it is considered one of the oldest living musical traditions in Europe. Joik is unique in that it often focuses on the individual or the landscape, with no specific lyrics but a connection to the person or place being represented.	
			</p>
			<h3><b>6. Social Structure and Communities</b></h3><br>
			<p>
				Historically, Sami society was organized into tribal groups or clans, with each group having its own distinct practices and territories. Family and community were central to Sami life, and social bonds were strengthened through shared responsibilities, especially in reindeer herding.
                       <br><br>		        
				Today, Sami communities are often organized around local councils or organizations that advocate for Sami rights and work to preserve their culture and heritage. In Norway, Sweden, and Finland, there are official Sami parliaments that represent the interests of the Sami people at the national level.

			</p>
			<h3><b>7. Sami in Modern Society</b></h3><br>
			<p>
				The Sami have faced significant challenges due to the historical policies of assimilation and displacement implemented by Scandinavian and Russian governments. These policies aimed to integrate the Sami into mainstream society, often at the expense of their traditional culture, language, and way of life.
                        <br><br>
				Today, many Sami live in urban areas, but a significant number still maintain their traditional lifestyles in rural or remote areas. Cultural revival has been a key movement in recent decades, with efforts to preserve and promote the Sami language, traditions, and rights.

				<br><br>
				In Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia, the Sami have gained recognition as indigenous peoples with specific rights, including the right to maintain their culture, access to land, and the protection of their languages. The Sami Parliaments in these countries play an important role in advocating for Sami rights and ensuring their cultural and political representation.
			</p>
			<h3><b>8. Sami Festivals and Celebrations</b></h3><br>
			<p>
				Johan is an important Sami festival that celebrates their heritage with traditional food, music, dance, and performances of Joik.
				<br><br>
				Sami National Day is celebrated on February 6, marking the day of the first Sami Congress in 1917, which was a turning point in the fight for Sami rights and recognition as an indigenous people. This day is marked by cultural events, speeches, and celebrations in S√°pmi and beyond.
                <br><br>
				Midwinter and Summer Solstice festivals are important for the Sami as they are deeply connected to the changing seasons and the rhythms of nature, which have a central place in Sami traditions.				
			</p>
			<h3><b>9. Challenges and Contemporary Issues</b></h3><br>
			<p>
			<b>Land Rights:</b> One of the key issues facing the Sami today is the dispute over land rights, especially regarding traditional reindeer herding grounds and the impact of industrial activities such as mining, logging, and hydroelectric projects. These activities often conflict with Sami traditions and rights to land.

				<br><br>
			<b>Climate Change: </b>	Climate change is increasingly affecting the Arctic regions where the Sami live, disrupting the natural environment and the traditional practices such as reindeer herding.

				<br><br>
			<b>Cultural Survival: </b>The Sami continue to fight for the preservation of their language, cultural practices, and traditions in the face of modernization, globalization, and encroachment by larger national identities.

              </p>
			<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3><br>
			<p>				
				The Sami people are one of Europe‚Äôs most resilient and distinctive indigenous groups, with a rich cultural heritage that spans thousands of years. Despite centuries of external pressures, the Sami continue to preserve their traditions and way of life, while adapting to the modern world. Through cultural revitalization efforts and political advocacy, the Sami strive to ensure their language, culture, and rights are protected for future generations. Their continued survival and thriving in the face of challenges are a testament to the strength and adaptability of their¬†community.
