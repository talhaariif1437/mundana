				The Israel-Palestine conflict has drawn in numerous countries over the decades, each with their own interests, alliances, and involvement in either mediating or exacerbating the situation. The role of foreign powers can be understood in terms of diplomatic, military, and economic support or opposition to the parties involved. Here’s an overview of the role of key international actors.
			</p>
			<h3><b>1. United States</b></h3><br>
			
			<p>
			  <b>Strong Support for Israel: </b>The U.S. has historically been one of Israel’s closest allies, providing significant military aid, diplomatic support, and economic assistance. This support includes U.S. vetoes at the UN Security Council to block resolutions critical of Israel.
                            <br><br>
		  <b>	Peace Efforts:</b> The U.S. has played a prominent role in peace initiatives, including the Camp David Accords (1978) between Israel and Egypt, the Oslo Accords (1993) between Israel and the Palestinians, and more recent attempts such as Donald Trump's "Deal of the Century" (2020).
                            <br><br>							
		 <b>Controversial Stance on Jerusalem: </b>The U.S. recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017 under President Donald Trump, a move that was widely criticized by Palestinians and much of the international community. This shift intensified tensions.
                            <br><br>
             <b> Military Aid:</b> The U.S. provides Israel with billions of dollars in military aid each year, helping Israel maintain a technological edge in the region, particularly in air defense systems like the Iron Dome.			
						</p>
			<h3><b>2. United Nations</b></h3><br>
			<p>
				<b>Resolutions and Peacekeeping:</b> The UN has been involved in various peacekeeping efforts and resolutions aimed at resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict. Key resolutions include UN Security Council Resolution 242 (1967), which calls for Israel’s withdrawal from territories occupied in the Six-Day War, and UN General Assembly Resolution 194 (1948), which calls for the return of Palestinian refugees.
                  <br><br>
				<b>Humanitarian Aid: </b>  The UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) provides vital humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees in the Middle East.
                  <br><br>

               <b> Calls for Two-State Solution: </b>The UN has endorsed the two-state solution as the most viable resolution to the conflict, but its influence is limited by vetoes and the political dynamics within the Security Council.
					</p>
			<h3><b>3. European Union(1967)</b></h3><br>
			<p>
				<b>Support for a Two-State Solution:</b> The EU has consistently called for a two-state solution and has been an advocate for Palestinian statehood. It supports peace negotiations and has called for an end to Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.
                     <br><br>
					<b> Humanitarian Aid: </b>European countries are significant donors to Palestinian humanitarian efforts, providing funding for development programs in the West Bank and Gaza.
                     <br><br>
					 
					<b> Criticism of Israeli Policies:</b> The EU has been vocal in its criticism of Israeli policies, particularly regarding settlements in the West Bank, which it considers illegal under international law. However, the EU has been divided at times in how to handle relations with Israel, balancing diplomatic ties with human rights concerns.
                     <br><br>
			</p>
			<h3><b>4. Arab Countries</b></h3><br>
			<p>
				<b>Palestinian Solidarity:</b> For decades, most Arab nations have shown strong support for the Palestinian cause, viewing it as a pan-Arab issue and a struggle for Arab self-determination against Israeli occupation.
                <br><br>
				<b>Diplomatic and Military Support:</b> Several Arab nations, notably Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, fought against Israel in wars such as the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the 1967 Six-Day War. However, after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, some Arab countries, especially Egypt and Jordan, sought peace with Israel.
                <br><br>
				
				<b>Camp David Accords (1978): </b>Egypt became the first Arab country to officially recognize Israel in exchange for the return of the Sinai Peninsula. This peace agreement, brokered by the U.S., led to Egypt being ostracized by other Arab states for a time.
                <br><br>
				
				<b>Arab League: </b>The Arab League has consistently advocated for Palestinian rights, and its Arab Peace Initiative (2002) called for normalization of relations with Israel in exchange for an end to Israeli occupation and the establishment of a Palestinian state.
                <br><br>

                <b>Recent Shifts:</b> Some Arab countries, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, and Morocco, have normalized relations with Israel through the Abraham Accords (2020), signaling a shift in the Arab approach. However, Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations have largely kept their stance on the Palestinian issue intact.

			</p>
			<h3><b>5. Iran</b></h3><br>
			<p>
				<b>Support for Palestinian Resistance:</b> Iran is a strong supporter of Palestinian resistance movements, particularly Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza. Iran provides financial, military, and logistical support to these groups as part of its broader goal of opposing Israeli and Western influence in the Middle East.
                <br><br>
				<b>Proxy Conflicts:</b> Iran’s involvement in the Israel-Palestine conflict is often indirect, through its support for militant groups in Gaza and Lebanon (such as Hezbollah). Iran’s role has contributed to the broader regional instability, including tensions with Israel over its influence in the Levant.
                <br><br>
				<b>Anti-Israel Stance:</b> Iran does not recognize Israel’s right to exist and has consistently called for the liberation of Palestine and the dismantling of the Israeli state.
                <br><br>


			</p>
			<h3><b>6. Russia</b></h3><br>
			<p>
				<b>Balance of Relations:</b> Russia has maintained a balance between its support for Palestinian statehood and its relationship with Israel. Moscow supports a two-state solution and has sought to position itself as a diplomatic player in the Middle East.
                 <br><br>
				<b> Involvement with Palestinian Groups:</b> Russia has maintained cordial relations with the PLO and other Palestinian factions, encouraging negotiations. However, Russia also has strong ties to Israel, particularly in the areas of trade, technology, and counterterrorism cooperation.
                 <br><br>
				 
				<b>Mediation Efforts:</b> Russia has attempted to mediate between Israel and the Palestinians, including hosting talks and offering to help facilitate peace initiatives, although it has not played a leading role in resolving the conflict.
			</p>
			<h3><b>7. Turkey</b></h3><br>
			<p>
				<b>Support for Palestinians:</b> Turkey, particularly under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has been a vocal supporter of Palestinian rights and has strongly criticized Israeli policies, particularly regarding the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem.
                  <br><br>
				<b>Diplomatic Tensions with Israel:</b> Turkey has had periods of diplomatic tension with Israel, especially over issues like the Gaza flotilla incident (2010), where Turkish activists were killed by Israeli forces during an attempt to break the blockade of Gaza.
                  <br><br>				  
				<b>Recent Relations:</b> While Turkey has advocated for Palestinian statehood, it also maintains relations with Israel, albeit strained at times. Turkey's position is often influenced by its broader strategic goals in the Middle East.
			</p>
			<h3><b>8. Other Key Actors</b></h3><br>
			<p>
				<b>Egypt:</b> As the most populous Arab country and a key player in Middle Eastern politics, Egypt has acted as a mediator between Israel and Palestinians, particularly in the context of ceasefires and peace talks. Egypt also plays a crucial role in the blockade of Gaza and has provided a security buffer between Gaza and Israel.
                   <br><br>
				<b>Jordan:</b> Jordan, which controls the holy sites in Jerusalem, has been a vocal advocate for Palestinian rights and has a peace treaty with Israel. It is also home to a large Palestinian refugee population.
                   <br><br>				   
				<b>Lebanon:</b> Lebanon’s Hezbollah is a key ally of Iran and has a long-standing rivalry with Israel. While Lebanon as a state does not directly engage in the conflict, Hezbollah’s presence in southern Lebanon adds a complex layer to the conflict.
                   <br><br>
                <b>International NGOs:</b> Numerous international organizations, such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the International Red Cross, are involved in providing humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians and advocating for human rights in the region.
			</p>
			<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3><br>
			<p>				
				The Israel-Palestine conflict is deeply shaped by the involvement of both regional and global actors. Countries like the United States, Iran, and Egypt have shaped the political and military dynamics of the conflict, while the United Nations and the European Union have focused on diplomatic efforts and humanitarian aid. Shifts in regional alliances, as seen with the Abraham Accords, continue to alter the landscape of the conflict, while underlying issues such as territorial disputes, refugee rights, and Jerusalem’s status remain unresolved. The involvement of these foreign powers, along with the local parties, continues to shape the trajectory of the conflict and the prospects for peace.
